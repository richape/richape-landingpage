## Introduction
I have recently completed the Level 6 Certificate in Applied Web Development through my work place, Dev Academy Aotearoa. I have always been fascinated in Tech from Digital Art to wanting to be a game developer. My reason for recently wanting to go on this journey was to engage better with students as a Human Skills Facilitator. Now I feel like I am able to this at a higher level as I have learnt what students go through on a day to day basis and what tech languages and packages students will be exposed while studying at Dev Academy. On top of this achievement I have found out more about my style of learning and a keen interest in using these skills to develop my work from study and personal projects.

## Projects
- [My Blog](https://richape.github.io/index.html): This is my first project I worked on as part of the Foundations of learning Web Development using html & CSS,
- [To do list](https://github.com/richape/Todo-List): This is a Todo list app that I did a code along to before Foundations using React.
- [Matrix Effect](https://github.com/richape/matrix-effect): This is a project that I have been playing around with in between study. Trying to build the Matrix effect using html, CSS and Javascript. Work in progress.
- I have a couple personal projects I have not started yet.
- One is a book a desk app for our work space where graduates who wish to come in to do some extra study or job hunting prep can book a desk. Users will be able to book a desk on a certain date or dates and also at what time.
- Another is a Human Skills reflection app for mobile and desktop, because Google forms is difficult to work with. Students will be able to create a log in and the app will include assessments and text area to complete reflections. I want to be able to implement some kind of notification for students as well, reflections will be saved and should be editable.
- [My Comics](Add link to project): Link will be added.
