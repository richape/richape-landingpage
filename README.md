## Introduction
I have recently completed the Level 6 Certificate in Applied Web Development through my work place, Dev Academy Aotearoa. I have always been fascinated in Tech from Digital Art to wanting to be a game developer. My reason for recently wanting to go on this journey was to engage better with students as a Human Skills Facilitator. Now I feel like I am able to this at a higher level as I have learnt what students go through on a day to day basis and what tech languages and packages students will be exposed while studying at Dev Academy. On top of this achievement I have found out more about my style of learning and a keen interest in using these skills to develop my work from study and personal projects.
